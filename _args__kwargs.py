#here if we considered args and not *args the interpreter would take only one value for args
#that value will be 1, but because of using *args it can take infinite values.
# *args (Non- keyword argurument)= Tuple
# **kwargs (Keyword agrument)= Tuple
# #The variable name could be anything that is followed by  a '*' but these names are a standard
